# unity_ros_lidar_3d
Unity package for simulating 3D Laser Scanner (LIDAR) and publishing the point cloud to ros2.

## This package implements following things
### A simple robot with 4 wheels
- A simple urdf file is created (along with xacro). This urdf file is imported to unity using urdf importer.
- A differential drive robot controller is implemented in unity. This subscribe to "cmd_vel" topic and generate commands for movement of robot in unity.

### LIDAR (3D laser Scanner)
- A 3D laser scanner sensor is implement using Ray Casting. It has parameters such as fov, angular_resolution (both horizontal and vertical), min_range, max_range etc.
- A Point Cloud publisher publish the generated point cloud to 'point_cloud' topic. It aslo publish the pose (position and orientation) of the laser_scanner to 'laser_scan_pose'.

 ### Notes
 -This package is in ROS2 meaning unity scripts in this are written for ROS2, so if you will select ROS1 in unity (in [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector)) it will show compilation error. By default ROS2 is selected but if you want to run this in ROS1 you have to modify scripts accordingly.
 - Please do read how unity-ros framework works. [ROS Unity Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) [ROS Unity Integration](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md)
 - User can edit xacro file and then generate urdf from it. And import new urdf into the unity to try different robot.
 - User can edit all parameters either from unity script or from panel.

## Installation and Running
- Read ROS-Unity integration (try few examples to get the grasp on ros-unity framework works in general). [ROS Unity Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) [ROS Unity Integration](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md)

### Installation
- Download this package and open in unity.
- Create a ros workspace and build package [ROS-TCP-Endpoint](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint) in the workspace by downloading approriate branch (ROS or [ROS2 Branch of ROS-TCP-Endpoint](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint/tree/main-ros2) ) from github.
- Install teleop-twist-keyboard package to control robot using keyboard
  - `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard` change the ROS-DISTRO name from neotic to your ROS-DISTRO

### Running
- Run ROS-TCP-Endpoint Server in one terminal [ROSâ€“Unity Demo Setup](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/setup.md)
  - ROS1: `roslaunch ros_tcp_endpoint endpoint.launch`
  - ROS2: `ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint`
- Click on play button in unity to start the simualtion
- Run rviz in another terminal and add tf and point cloud topics to rviz for displaying them
  - ROS1: `rosrun rviz rviz`
  - ROS2: `rviz2`
- Run teleop_twist_keyboard in another terminal and control the robot using keyboard
  - ROS1: `rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`
  - ROS2: `ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard`

## Credits
- Most of the code is from [Navigation 2 SLAM Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Nav2-SLAM-Example). Following addition/modifications are made
  - Laser scanner code to make it scan in 3D as well as fast and publish [point cloud message](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html).
  - AGVController script has been modified and renamed as Robot Controller to control 4 wheel robot instead of 2.
